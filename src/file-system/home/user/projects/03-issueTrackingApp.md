### • Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL (Instagres),
### • Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Authentication, CRUD

Issue Tracking App is a focused issue-management system inspired by modern trackers.  
The project implements the essential workflows you expect from a lightweight tracker: secure authentication, create, view, edit and delete issues, plus a responsive list view with simple filters.

Built with Next.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind and backed by PostgreSQL (Instagres). The code emphasises clear server routes, type-safe models (Prisma), and a small, auditable API surface suitable for production.
