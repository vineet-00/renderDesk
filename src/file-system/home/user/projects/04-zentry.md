## *Zentry*

### • React, GSAP, TailwindCSS

A motion-first landing inspired by the Awwwards-winning Zentry.  
Built with React for structure, GSAP for expressive timelines, and Tailwind for rapid layout. The project explores scroll-driven choreography, layered parallax, and reusable animation primitives that make the UI feel tactile and deliberate.

The build emphasises:
- clear motion systems (timelines & staggered reveals),
- performance and accessibility (reduced-motion, lazy assets),
- and compact, reusable React components that encapsulate animation behaviour.
