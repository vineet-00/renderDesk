RenderDesk is a small, playful portfolio built with TypeScript and Three.js. It includes an interactive 3D retro computer, a tiny UNIX-style shell, a virtual file system, a Markdown interpreter/renderer, and a compact text layout engine. The project explores hands-on WebGL UI patterns with an emphasis on clarity, performance and reusability.
