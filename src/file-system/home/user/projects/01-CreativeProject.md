### • p5.js, JavaScript, Generative Art,
### • Simulations, WEBGL, Games, Data Visualization

A curated collection of 50+ creative coding experiments built with p5.js — ranging from generative art to physics-based simulations. The project includes classic systems like flow fields, fractal trees, particle swarms, and diffusion-limited aggregation; alongside interactive sketches such as pathfinding visualizers (A Star, Dijkstra), evolutionary algorithms, Markov text generators, and TF–IDF-based text analysis tools.
