# Hi there

I'm Vineet Sahu — a software developer who builds fast, maintainable, and polished web interfaces. I focus on frontend engineering with pragmatic design, quality, and performance, and I can contribute across the stack when needed.

I build production-ready interfaces and interactive demos that balance aesthetics with performance — from dashboard UX to generative sketches and compact AI-powered tools.

## Outside the code
Curious about design, economics and emerging tech. I recharge on mountain hikes and experimenting with creative web visuals.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed over past few years.
