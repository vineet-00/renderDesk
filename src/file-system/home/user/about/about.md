# Hi there

I'm Vineet Sahu — a software engineer who turns fuzzy product asks into fast, maintainable, and polished web interfaces using React, Next.js, Astro and TypeScript. I also build interactive visuals with Three.js and compact AI-powered tools.

### Outside the code
Curious about design, economics and emerging tech. I split my time between the gym, mountain trails, and spiritual practice — staying disciplined, curious and grounded makes me a better engineer and an easier person to build with.

Type cd ~/projects then ls to see details of some of the projects I’ve built.
